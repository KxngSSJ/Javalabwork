	<h1>The legendary story of Naruto Uzumaki </h1>
	<!--Information on the anime-->
	<h2> Naruto lores</h2>
	<p> It tells the story of Naruto Uzumaki, a young ninja who seeks recognition from his peers and dreams of becoming the Hokage, the leader of his village. The story is told in two parts – the first set in Naruto's pre-teen years, and the second in his teens.In the first part of naruto he struggled with depression as he was ostracized by the people of the leaf village as they viewed him as a monster rather than a child that need affection. They viewed him as a monster because when he was just a baby his father and mother sealed half a tailed beast into his body for the sake of the village but the people of the village do not know of this but only that he is the holder of the nine tails tailed beast. The other half was sealed within his father with the help of his mother but sadly they both died in the choas of the sealing jutsu which left him alone in the world as an orphan but while his father was dying he asked his mentor the third hokage to take care of his son for him and not to let naruto know about how they had died.<p/>
